card-content: Iâ€™ve helped craft products for many well-known clients, including Apple, Lowes, Kroger, and Yum, as well as many smaller clients and start-ups. My focus has always been to understand the audience, develop empathy for those users, and create a delightful and empowering product. In addition, I bring a toolbox of creative talents to my projects, such as branding, graphic design, 2-D and 3-D motion graphics, and a mastery of HTML and CSS - allowing me to find unique solutions to problems.
