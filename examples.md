card-content: I create products that align to the stakeholders wants and the users needs. Iâ€™ve led projects for many well-known clients, including Apple, Lowes, Kroger, and Yum, as well as many start-ups and smaller clients. My focus has always been to understand the audience, develop empathy for those users, and create a delightful and empowering product. I communicate across teams and work with developers to ensure that what I'm proposing to be built can be built and in a reasonable timeline.
