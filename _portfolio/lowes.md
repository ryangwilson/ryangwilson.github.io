overview: Bitovi was hired to build the web app for running, reviewing, and setting up rules for Lowes Iris home automation products. During our engagement we noticed that there was no direct way for users to purchase products through the webapp. Instead, users would have to navigate away from the Iris app to Lowes.com to find and purchase additional home automation products.
problemstatement: In the Lowes Iris app, users are able to see what products they need to be able to do a certain task. For example, a user could see that with the right product they could set up rules for watering their lawn. However, to purchase the product the user had to navigate away from the Iris app to Lowes.com to find and purchase the product want. <br><br> The Bitovi team identified this as a place to connect users with products.

process: Bitovi had already been building the application, so we knew what the possibilites were in integrating product sales within the product. Working alongside of a Bitovi developer, we created two optional flow solutions that we took to the client for approval.
