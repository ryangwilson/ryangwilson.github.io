overview: Yum! Brands assembled a team to help in the research and creation of a menu management tool (MMT) for the brands they operate (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell) to use.

 I can not publicly share a visual representation of this product</i>.
problemstatement: The problem the project needed to solve is to create a single tool to manage all of the data that makes up products, menus, discounts, pricing, taxes, store data, etc. for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell – US locations, to be rolled out internationally in the future. Each brand has its own glossary for how they refer to things like products, discounts, etc.
users: The users for this product are data managers, store owners, general managers, customer support staff, marketing coordinators, and tax professionals for major restaurant brands.
