phases: Discovery
tools: Research, Observation, Survey, Documentation, Presentation
overview: I was contracted to run a discovery to identify the requirements for refining the Johnson & Johnson internal ticketing tool 'Iris'. The client had an internal ticketing tool to request IT support like getting a new office phone set up, ordering a new computer, requesting software, etc. Yet, their employees were calling customer support for help with issues that the automated ticketing tool could support at a high rate. The client wanted to decrease the number of calls into the support line and increase the use of the automated ticketing app.
problemstatement: Users were calling IT support more than using the self-service method through the company intranet. Every phone call to support costs 10 to 20 times the cost of using the self-service tool.
goals: <ul><li>Improve awareness of the self-service platform</li><li>Improve flow through the product</li><li>Make the self-service option more prominent</li><li>Reduce the user impulse to call IT before seeking to solve their issue first</li></ul>
role: Product Designer
scope: Eight Weeks
tools: Research, Observation, Testing, Documentation, Presentation, Sketch, InVision
methods: <ul><li>UX advocacy with the client teams</li><li>Researched user needs through surveys and observations of existing application</li><li>Recommended and user tested interaction improvements through user flows</li><li>Created wireframes for demonstrating workflow improvements</li></ul>
process: I began by working with J&J stakeholders to understand the product. I then performed two sets of user interviews and user observations with U.S.-based and international employees.</br></br>It was my intended goal to make recommendations to streamline the ticketing process; however, I found that many employees were not aware of the availability of the product or had a negative relationship with the ticketing application.<br> <br>From the interview and observation data, I developed a persona deck representing user types. I think documented existing user flows for the ticking creation process. This allowed me to refine user flows, recommending an improved process.<br> <br>After vetting the user flows with the technical team and the stakeholders, I created wireframes and prototypes to test my assumptions.
findings: <b>User Interviews</b> <ul><li>Normalize Language (human language, not technical)</li><li>Remove unnecessary fields from forms</li><li>Autofill inputs where possible</li><li>Add in valid form validation and clear human language when items do not validate</li><li>If the goal is to get base users to support themselves first, channel users to learning first, or visually prioritize learning ahead of tickets, chat, and the phone number</li><li>Going to need to do some type of rollout notification prior to the changes</li><li>An Iris onboarding overlay/support would help for both new and infrequent users and make it sexy and interesting so people pay attention</li><li>Clear alerts/change logs on main page when items do change/move</li><li>Top 5/10 items searched by individual users widget</li></ul> <br><b>User Observations</b><ul><li>Users say they are familiar with the system, but we saw a lot of hunt and peck methodology in finding what the user is searching for</li><li>A few users noted that they have never used the “Learn How To” section; some mentioned that it was because they were not aware of it</li><li>Two people of the eleven observed used the search bar(s); one people was using questions to search with and not finding results</li><li>Only one user used the ‘Find in Page’ feature built in to every browser to find terms on the page</li><li>Update search bar(s) to be a unified bar that does weighted contextual searches</li><li>Give users some training on how to find things in Iris, giving priority to the learning catalogue</li><li>Consider the use and color of the tabbed browsing; most users observed did not use them and stayed on ‘Submit a Request’ landing page/tab through each task</li></ul> <br><b>User Quotes</b><ul><li>“They don’t understand what I’m trying to say” – speaking of Support staff</li><li>“I’m never sure where it might be” – speaking of an item or category in the Iris system</li><li>“I use the QuickLaunch all the time and love it”</li><li>“There are too many choices” – speaking to amount of categories and items</li><li>“There is room for improvement“ – speaking to the entire Iris system</li><li>“I would appreciate a real person“ – speaking in context of the Iris robot icon</li><li>“When I’m mad at the system I call it ISIS”</li><li>“I’m the type of person who is not always confident that it is right, so I’ll call I.T.“ – speaking on unclear listing and catalogue items</li><li>“I always start using Iris here; it is easy for me” – speaking to QuickLaunch</li><li>“This isn’t intuitive” – speaking to the entire Iris system</li><li>“This is a verbose overview of what I’m supposed to do” – speaking to the excessive language of the Learn How To documentation</li></ul>
processlist: <ul><li>User Flows</li><li>Sketches</li><li>Wireframes</li><li>Prototypes</li><li>User Testing</li></ul>
solutions: I created and vetted improved user flows that would be more user-friendly, direct users to use the self-service documentation, and empower users to find solutions before contacting the support team. I created refined user flows to improve ticket times and improve self-service. I developed and tested an updated wireframe prototype concept with users. 
outcomes: Future version of the Iris self-service portal would be more usable and direct users towards a self-service path. Long forms were recommended to be reduced to only necessary information.
achievements: <ul><li>Captured a detailed understanding of what users are looking for in a ticketing system</li> <li>Increased awareness of self-support</li> <li>Recommended a streamlined user flow to reduce time to report an issue</li> <li>Recommended uniform design patterns to increase usability of UI</li> </ul>
takeaways: One of the difficulties I encountered on this project was that the team I was working with did not fully realize the UX process and saw my role as recommending visual UI improvements and redesigning the product page by page. I compromised in my UX process, providing high-fidelity visual representations to satisfy the stakeholder while still doing the right thing for the UX process in the background. <br> <br>If I could do this project again, while I was a strong advocate for the UX process during my engagement, I would have sat down with the stakeholder in the first week and asked for explicit expectations. 
learnings: For future client contracts, in every kickoff meeting, I explicitly outline what services I would provide paired with visual representations of each deliverable. This was to set expectations at the beginning of the project. Then in each weekly demonstration, I closed each meeting by stating the tasks I would be performing the following week and asking the client if what I was showing was what they were expecting to see and if they saw value in what I was providing. This way, I collected stakeholder buy-in weekly, allowing me to address potential issues in real-time and pivot when necessary.
