overview: Johnson & Johnson had an internal ticketing tool, yet their employees were calling customer support for help with issues that the automated ticking tool could support at a high rate. The client wanted to decrease the number of calls into the support line and increase usage of the automated ticketing app.
problemstatement: I was engaged for an eight-week discovery phase to identify the requirements for refining an internal ticketing tool. I began by performing at two different sets of user interviews and user observations both onsite at a J&J facility in New Jersey, as well as remote interviews and observations with international J&J employees.</br></br>It was my intended goal to make recommendations to streamline the ticketing process, however, I found that many employees were not aware of the availability of the product, or had a negative relationship with the ticketing application. </br></br> One of the difficulties I encountered on this project was that the team I was working with did not fully realize the UX process and saw my role as recommending visual UI improvements and redesigning the product page by page.

solutions: <ul><li>I worked a flexed schedule to accommodate meeting times with international testers</li><li>I worked with translators provided by J&J to assist during user testing to help when translation was needed</li><li>I advocated for the UX process, gave demonstrations in team meetings to support my methodology, and hosted UX training sessions to support changing minds</li><li>I compromised in my UX process, making sure to provide high-fidelity visual representations to satisfy the stakeholder while still doing the right thing for the UX process in the background</li></ul>
outcome: <ul><li>I created and vetted improved user flows that would be more user-friendly, would direct users to use the self-service documentation, and empower users to find solutions before contacting the support team</li><li>I created and tested an updated wireframe prototype concept</li><li>I performed heuristics reviews and UX design reviews of the product</li><li>I provided high-fidelity mockups for screens that needed improvement based on patterning and similar components identified in reviews</li></ul>
value: <ul><li>Captured a detailed understanding of what users are looking for in a ticketing system</li> <li>Increased awareness of self-support</li> <li>Recommended a streamlined user flow to reduce time to report an issue</li> <li>Recommended uniform design patterns to increase usability of UI</li> </ul>
