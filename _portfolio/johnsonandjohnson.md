overview: Bitovi was asked to help with the product discovery for the improvement of an internal ticketing software tool used at Johnson & Johnson
problemstatement: Johnson & Johnson had an internal ticketing tool, yet their employees were calling customer support for help with issues that the automated ticking tool could support at a high rate. The client wanted to decrease the amount of calls into the support line and increase usage of the automated ticketing app.

process: We were engaged for an eight-week discovery phase to identify the requirements for refining an internal ticketing tool. We began by performing at two different user interviews and user observations at a J&J facility in New Jersey, as well as remote interviews and observations with international J&J employees. It was our goal to streamline the ticketing process, however, we found that employees were not aware of the availability of the product, or had a negative relationship with the ticketing application.

outcome: We created and vetted improved user flows that would be more user friendly, would direct users to use the self-service documentation, and empower users to find solutions before contacting the support team. From those flows we created and tested an updated wireframe prototype concept.
