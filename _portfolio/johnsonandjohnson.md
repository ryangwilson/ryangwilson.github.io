overview: Bitovi was asked to help with the product discovery for the improvement of an internal ticketing software tool used at Johnson & Johnson
problemstatement: Johnson & Johnson had an internal ticketing tool, yet their employees were calling customer support for help with issues that the automated ticking tool could support at a high rate. The client wanted to decrease the number of calls into the support line and increase usage of the automated ticketing app.

process: We were engaged for an eight-week discovery phase to identify the requirements for refining an internal ticketing tool. We began by performing at two different user interviews and user observations at a J&J facility in New Jersey, as well as remote interviews and observations with international J&J employees. It was our goal to streamline the ticketing process, however, we found that employees were not aware of the availability of the product, or had a negative relationship with the ticketing application.

outcome: We created and vetted improved user flows that would be more user-friendly, would direct users to use the self-service documentation, and empower users to find solutions before contacting the support team. From those flows, we created and tested an updated wireframe prototype concept.
value: <ul><li>Captured a detailed understanding of what users are looking for in a ticketing system</li> <li>Increased awareness of self-support</li> <li>Recommended a streamlined user flow to reduce time to report an issue</li> <li>Recommended uniform design patterns to increase usability of UI</li> </ul>
