overview: The client approached us with a concept - Truck drivers lose money whenever they have to drive home with partial or completely empty trailers – how do we help them fill their trucks?<br/><br/>In three months, the client wanted to unveil a solution at a trade show. In that time, we delivered a fully-functional mobile app in both Android and Apple app stores.
problemstatement: Truck drivers lose money when they have empty space on their trucks. Driving back to home-base with an empty trailer is called 'deadheading'. Not only does an empty truck mean that there won't be a paycheck associated wit delivering goods, but also the cost of fuel on the return trip.<br/><br/>HaulHound had the idea to build an application that would be 'the Uber for the trucking industry'. This application would give truck drivers the ability to fill a portion or all empty space in their trailer using a mobile and web-based logistics search engine. Users can search and schedule pickups in their destination city so they won't have to drive back empty.
users: The users of HaulHound target the owner-operator truck driver.

constraints: The truck driver user spends most of their time driving. We are creating a mobile application to assist them in filling their trucks, yet we don't want the user to user their mobile device while driving.

outcome: In three months time we took the stakeholders idea from concept to MVP – but really more than that. In three moths time we had a highly polished application ready for users to be rolled out at a trade show. Along with all of the product design work, we helped to - Refine the HaulHound logo, develop marketing materials and trade show backdrops, and create 3D animations and promotional videos for display at the roll-out trade show.
