I"ñ<p>My goal as a user experience specialist is to understand a product and its users as much as I can. I aim to make the best recommendations and decisions that align with the wants of the stakeholder and the user's needs. Superior products help to solve users' pain points and simplify complex tasks. The best user experiences don't cause friction and disappear into the background gracefully.</p>

<p>My passion for UX lies in approaching something that I know little about and quickly learning as much as possible through research, workshops, observations, surveys, and talking with users. In this process, I want to understand as much as I can, vet my understanding with stakeholders and developers, and then question, iterate and improve the product.</p>

<p>I love creating user flows, stepping through them, and iterating until there is a seamless architectural flow. Many developers have raved about the user flows I provide, giving them a road map to build from and making their jobs easier. I can then start framing out wireframe UI concepts from my user flows, leading me to my second favorite part of the process; prototyping. I have a background in interactive design, so I think that I find creating and wiring prototypes in Figma or Axure so fun.</p>
