overview: Yum Brands assembled a team to help in the research and creation of a menu management system for the brands they operate (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell) to use. I worked as the Product Owner for 12 months on the MMS tool project before migrating to overseeing the product design and user experience research. I also helped perform user testing for the new Taco Bell point of sale (POS) system. <br><br> Due to an NDA, I can not share a representation of this product.
problemstatement: The problem the project needed to solve is to create a single tool to manage all of the data that makes up a sellable product for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell â€“ US locations, to be rolled out internationally in the future. Each brand has its own glossary of what they call sellable items and the components that make up a sellable item.
users: The users for this product are data managers for major restaurant brands.
