  <h2>Product Process, <br>Project Pricing</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">The return on investment exceeds the cost of the project</p>
  <p>The most successful way to achieve a superior product is to go through the correct process. For product design, this is a process of creating requirements, documenting purpose, and refining ideas. Requirements understanding is broken up into phases for delivery. Each phase drills down into product requirements in more detail.</p>
</div>

      <section>
        <p>The idea around having phased engagements is to define requirements and understand what needs to be built for the
  product. Products should never be built based on gut-feelings or assumptions of user and user needs. After each
  phase, you will have a document package that you can take with you and use it to shop around for additional
  refinement or development. We would of course like to tackle your project from start to finish; Discovery,
  Refinement, Development, and Product Review.</p>

<p>The product process helps:
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly articulate high-level requirements</li>
    <li>Refine requirements, documentation, and concepts</li>
    <li>Speed up development through understanding</li>
    <li>Validate a product through testing with real users, analyzing results, and applying user feedback</li>
    <li>Weed out potential issues sooner, saving time fixing or concepting design, flow, and interaction problems
      later</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Our budget-conscious clients trend towards shorter engagements. We understand, however we do want to communicate that
  with less time in the refinement phase we will have less time to more finely define requirements, find and close
  gaps, and create and refine aesthetic, and document concepts. This may leave you with more uncertainty as you move
  on to the development phase.</p>

<p>We only bill for the hours we actually work – that means that if we propose something will take four weeks and it
  takes two weeks, we only bill for two weeks worth of work.</p>

<p>We offer a ten percent discounted rate for clients who sign a contract for more than one phase upfront. However,
  because the purpose of understanding requirements helps us estimate later phases of work, we will have to come to an
  agreement at the time of signing the contract for contingencies for adding more time once we have more certainty
  around requirements.</p>

        <p>The best way to a successful project is to start with a clear vision of what needs to be built. The
          purpose of a product discovery phase is to understand and clearly articulate high-level requirements
          for a product. The goals of the client are examined and itemized, and both the client and the end
          user help to influence the high-level requirements throughout the discovery phase.</p>

        <p>The more information that is known prior to a discovery phase will help to speed up the process.
          However any prior understanding and assumptions will be questioned by the product designer to create
          a clear understanding of requirements.</p>

        <p>A typical discovery phase can be completed in six to ten weeks, depending on the size and scope of
          the product. Smaller products will typically take less time to research and develop high-level
          requirements. Larger products will take longer. The more time we have to spend with a project of any
          size, the more confidence we have in our high-level recommendations.</p>

        <p>In the product refinement phase, our goal is to drill-down into the understanding gained in the
          discovery phase to finely define project requirements within the allotted time frame. The more time
          we have to refine goals and requirements, the more certainty we will have in our recommendations.
          That said, the less time we have to explore and define project requirements, the less certainty we
          will have around our recommendations.</p>

        <p>The product refinement phase picks up from where the discovery phase leaves off. We take the defined
          high-requirements from the discovery phase and refine them through ideation, testing, and iteration.
        </p>

        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <p>Decisions about the visual aesthetic of the user interface UI start to come into play after initial
          rounds of refinement have taken place. Having existing brand requirements helps to speed the visual
          process along, however, adding visual value is incremental and needs to be tested. With each
          repetition of Develop, Design, Create, Test, and Refine, we will iterate on the visual aesthetic of
          the mockups. UI design moves from:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wireframes – rough layout concepts to communication content and placement – to</li>
          <li>Low-fidelity mockups – cleaned up versions of the rough layout concepts – to</li>
          <li>Medium-fidelity mockups – transitional design beginning to add branding concepts – to</li>
          <li>High-fidelity mockups – tested and vetted visuals that will serve as the visual requirements for
            the layout, placement, and development of the product</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The goal of iterative product design is to create and prove why components, content, and interactions
          are placed where they are. We strongly recommend not jumping forward with the aesthetic design until
          the product concept has been fully tested. There are several reasons for not going high-fidelity
          visual design too quickly:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It takes time to make a product look really good aesthetically. Testing and iterating through a
            product can cause layouts and flows to be torn down, thrown out, and rethought, thus wasting the
            time spent creating the high-fidelity design.</li>
          <li>Similarly, it takes time to iterate on any fidelity mockup, but the more pixel perfect the
            design gets, the longer it takes to make changes.</li>
          <li>In testing, users are less likely to give direct and honest feedback if an application looks
            “finished”. When the design is a little more rough, a user is more likely to suggest larger
            changes to a product or a layout.</li>
          <li>We simply don’t know what our high-fidelity recommendations for your product will be without
            iterating through the process. If you are looking for concept design to help you get funding for
            your project, we do offer that as a service, but the process is different than in the refinement
            phase, and we strongly advise for any concept designs to then be tested and vetted with users
            before they are used to make product requirements.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For longer engagements, we will bring on a visual designer to work alongside the product designer. We
          will bring them up to speed on the product, and they will support moving from low- to high-fidelity
          UI design.</p>

        <p>The more time we have to Develop, Design, Create, Test, and Refine and move through visual design,
          we:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify and fill gaps</li>
          <li>Vet concepts with our developers so we are proposing concepts that we know can be built and
            built efficiently</li>
          <li>Explore and document all possible states of UI components</li>
          <li>Develop a more complete style guide</li>

        <p>From our experience, even from the most complete refinement phases and complete style guides, and
          complete documentation, there will always be a certain level of uncertainty and product
          functionality and the user interface when it comes to development. This is why we offer product
          support contracts that range from part-time to full-time engagement.</p>

        <p>A full-time product support contract will especially be important for those clients who have chosen a
          shorter refinement phase. This allows a product designer the time necessary to define and outline
          any edge cases that may arise in development, or to flesh out any interactions and components that
          were not given enough time or attention in earlier phases.</p>

        <p>One of the most common occurrences we see speaking to the value of a support contract is a developer
          asking “what is the __component name__ supposed to look like in a
          resting/active/disabled/fill-in-the-blank state?”. A support contract gives you the piece of mind
          that everything will have eyes on it and decisions will be based on understanding and documentation
          – as opposed to someone else making the decision that it should “probably be like this” or worse
          “that is good enough”.</p>

        <p>We recommend budgeting for a full-time, forty hour a week, product designer for every week of your
          development contract if you chose a shorter refinement phase, or we did not perform your refinement
          phase, and there is more uncertainty around your product.</p>

        <p>We recommend budgeting for a part-time, ten or twenty hour per week, product designer for every week
          of your development contract if we performed your product refinement phase, but did a shorter
          engagement due to budget constraints.</p>
