  <h2>About Ryan G<span>.</span> Wilson</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Product Designer, Graphic Designer, Leader</p>
  <p>Ryan is a Product Designer working for Bitovi. For over twenty years Ryan has been creating products with the user in mind. His passions are in the User Experience Process - research, understanding the user, developing product requirements, creating mockups and building prototypes, and iterating through documentation. He aims to understand and empathize with the needs, wants, and limitations of end-users to help create a better experience for that end-user.</p>

      <p>One of the most important things that clients are looking for is trustworthyness. "Can this person know what they are doing and can do the work that they are saying they can?". Ryan has found that the best way to show ability and trust is through the voices of people he has worked with in the past.</p>
      

<div class="card-container">
    
    <a class="reference-card third" href="experience/#Brehaut">
        <p>Value-driven is a term that often gets thrown around undeservingly. Ryan is the exception because he wears his values on his sleeve (in the most positive way). His values guide how he works, builds a team, mentors employees, and excels at his craft. 

He knows more about design than anybody I've worked with and is passionate about continuously putting out the best product possible. He is a deliberate and thoughtful designer who constantly seeks feedback from users to stress-test assumptions and ensure the right product gets put to market. 

He also understands and cares about people. Whether they are teammates, employees, users, or clients, Ryan listens and communicates with an open mind. Ryan is one of the finest people I've worked with. If you are looking to hire him or work with him as well, you will not be disappointed.</p>

        <p>Ryan is an amazing designer and I have really enjoyed working with him. He designed our tax engine UI which not only looked awesome but also really simplified what is an inherently complex process. 

When we needed to iterate on our design to accommodate our release timelines he quickly worked with our team to pivot on the designs as well!</p>

        <p>Fun, flexible, collaborative, and whip smart--these adjectives only begin to describe Ryan as a colleague. 'Creative' has a variety of meanings and plenty of nuance, and Ryan embodies it all. Ryan led a visual design project for my team, and to our delight he turned it into an experience. He takes the time to understand the challenge, is always open to feedback, and his designs exceed expectations. Using simple, replicable techniques, Ryan's independent project sustained the design needs of our initiative for many months to come. I'd recommend him without hesitation, and I look forward to working with him again, too.</p>
