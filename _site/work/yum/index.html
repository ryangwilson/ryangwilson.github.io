            <p>I joined the Yum! team as a consultant in the role of Product Owner and UX Specialist for an enterprise menu management tool (MMT). The MMT's purpose is to create products, pricing, taxes, store information, combo deals, and more for the Yum! Brands Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut.<br> <br>Each of the brands, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC had its own legacy MMTs, glossaries, and processes for updating data. It was essential to observe and research how each brand was accomplishing tasks, listen to users' and multiple stakeholders' needs, and recommend solutions that work across all brands.</p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        The MMT would be a place for users to create and input all details necessary for a fully functional store and would eventually be a single-source product for many different user types. Each user type would have its purposes and tasks within the product. All of the data within the MMT would feed into brand applications and eCommerce solutions like KFC.com to supply product details, store hours, product information, and pricing by location. This data would flow to stores for back-of-house and <a href="">point of sale systems</a>.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <div class="flex-two-col">
          <div class="col-left flex-third">
            <p>I started this project, like every project, by creating a repository where all documentation will live. There was a lot of information to capture, refine, and establish an understanding of. There were four existing products to review and refine into a single product. I started by familiarizing myself with all of the different MMTs currently in use by Yum! And the brands. I met with and observed our initial primary user focus, Data Managers. I watched multiple Data Managers for each of the brands step through their workflow, asking for clarification as needed. These observations helped to call out pain points and issues around all four systems.<br> <br>There would be a lot of effort towards modernizing, simplifying, and streamlining flows and processes. I developed a persona deck representing this product's wide range of users. I wrote user stories, groomed tickets with the business analyst, and helped research and define how features would work within the MMT. I created and refined used flows and worked with devs to vet concepts to align on "when" and "how" to build features.<br> <br>I ran workshops with stakeholders from Yum! and the three brands. I collaborated with stakeholders and other POs to create and align project timelines. The focus of my work was to define requirements and conceptualize a single product that would accommodate the needs of multiple users and different use cases, satisfy the needs of all of the brands, and support the implementation of the product.<br> <br>I helped align expectations for my team and across pods. I called out gaps and helped format sprint planning. I worked with the team, stakeholders, and other POs to drive goals, set feature timelines, and outline requirements for features, interactions, and refinements.<br> <br>Using Material UI as our library, I developed common UI patterns and created wireframes for developers to reference and build from. I planned, performed, and reported on user testing. And I QA'd builds to ensure that the proposed designs were implemented as expected.</p>

            <h4>What would I do differently?</h4>
            <p>Based on developer preference, we based the UI elements of the product on the Material UI package. Material UI is fine, but I feel that our pattern design was limited. If I could do this again, I would have recommended using TailwindCSS. Tailwind would have provided more flexibility in our patterns and design elements over time.</p>
            
          <h4>How did I grow?</h4>
            <p>The thing that I took away from this project is the value of living in a state of uncertainty. This project was massive, and there was lots of information to capture, understand, and organize. Connections between concepts were not always apparent in the short term.<br> <br>In my career, I've frequently had stakeholders tell me that their product "was for everyone." The Yum! MMT was the first project where I can recall that being true. It was essential to understand all potential user types, the tasks they would perform, and what interaction patterns are available across each scenario. Having an organized design system was necessary to align the team on solutions.</p>
