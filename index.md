card-content: I have always gravitated toward leadership. I became an Art Director at 23, led countless client projects as a UX Designer, and ran a successful UX Department. As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="color:white">INFJ</a>, I am passionate about what I do, and I'm interested in finding solutions to solve others' problems. I have always been in tune with the needs of others around me. I am creative and have expressed myself through any artistic medium I could access since I was young. I am empathetic and sympathetic to the people I lead and the users for whom I design products.
section-title-01: Leadership Approach
content-01a: Great teams are successful because of the culture they embody. I help nurture my team's culture by being supportive, putting myself out there as an equal member of the group, and creating an open environment to learn, grow, and create exceptional work.
content-01b: I have found that understanding who a team member is, what is going on in their life outside of work, and what motivates them can help me empathize with them and be as inclusive as possible in my team. It also helps answer the "why" question if a team member seems distant or not to be effective in their work.
